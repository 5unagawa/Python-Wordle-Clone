# Python Wordle Clone
"PWC" shamelessly jumps on the Wordle trend. I made this Python version with the dictionary tailored for use by my Japanese junior high school students. (Grades 7 -9)
I wanted to make something that my students (hopefully) will find interesting that also helps me to keep improving my Python skills.
Since I have been enjoying Wordle, I thought that my students might like to try playing Wordle but with some easier words that they have learned in class.
The vocabulary is sourced from the "Sunshine" English textbooks which are used in my area.

As of writing, the game is playable using the command line. I hope to implement a UI soon so that it is more accesible .

Thanks for stopping by!
