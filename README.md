# Python Wordle Clone
"PWC" shamelessly jumps on the Wordle trend. I made this Python version with a dictionary tailored for use by my Japanese junior high school students. (Grades 7 - 9)
Since I have been enjoying Wordle, I thought that my students might like to try playing Wordle but with some easier words that they have learned in class.
The vocabulary is sourced from the "Sunshine" English textbooks which are used in my region.
I wanted to make something that my students (hopefully) will find interesting that also helps me to keep improving my Python skills.

As of writing, the game is playable using the command line. I hope to implement a UI soon..

Thanks for stopping by!

#Update
I have just remembered that my schools use Chromebooks so I am now going to have to make this into a web application instead of a standalone application like I had first hoped.
However, I will still implement a UI for the sake of practice üëç
